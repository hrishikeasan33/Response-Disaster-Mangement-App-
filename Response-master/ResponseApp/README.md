# Once cloned, do the following to make sure the app runs perfectly:

### iOS:
1. Make sure app has a Info.plist file in "ios/Runner/" folder having the following code for location permissions:
	```
	<key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
	<false/>
	<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Response App needs access to location when open.</string>

	<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Response App needs access to location when in the background.</string>

	<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Response App needs access to location when open and in the background</string>```

3. Make sure app has a AppDelegate.swift  file in "ios/Runner/" folder having the Google API key for Google Maps SDK.
4. This is a no brainer, "ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist".

### Android:
1. This is a no brainer again, "android/app/google-services.json"
2. Make sure app has a local.properties file in the `Project -> Android`, if not:
	* Go to your  `Project -> Android`
	* Create a file  `local.properties` file
	* Open the file and Paste your Android SDK path depending on the operating system:
		a. Windows
			`sdk.dir = C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Local/Android/sdk`

		b. Linux or MacOS
			`sdk.dir = /home/USERNAME/Android/sdk`

		Replace  `USERNAME`  with your user name

3. Next, [Adding Google Maps API key to Android App carefully!](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key)

### Chatbot:
1. Download a JSON file from the [google cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) which helps your App to connect to the Chatbot Dialog flow Agent.
	* Incase you have no clue as to what is to be done, follow [How to add a ChatBot in Flutter using DialogFlow!](https://medium.com/flutterdevs/chatbot-in-flutter-using-dialogflow-70e28665a827)
2. Once downloaded, rename file to "credentials.json"
3. Place the credentials.json file in the "assets/json/" folder

- flutter clean
- flutter doctor
- flutter pub get

**iOS Specific, `cd ios`**
- pod repo update
- pod update
- sudo gem install cocoapods
- pod setup
