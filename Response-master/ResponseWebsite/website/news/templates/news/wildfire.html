                                       <li>Designate a room that can be closed off from outside air. Close all doors and windows. Set up a portable air cleaner to keep indoor pollution levels low when smoky conditions exist.</li>
                                       <li>Keep important documents in a fireproof, safe place. Create password-protected digital copies.</li>

                                       <li>Find an outdoor water source with a hose that can reach any area of your property.</li>
                                       <li>Create a fire-resistant zone that is free of leaves, debris, or flammable materials for at least 30 feet from your home.</li>
                                       <li>Review insurance covers to make sure it is enough to replace your property.</li>

                                       <li>Listen to authorities to find out when it is safe to return, and whether water is safe to drink.</li>
                                       <li>Avoid hot ash, charred trees, smoldering debris, and live embers. The ground may contain heat pockets that can burn you or spark another fire. Consider the danger to pets and livestock.</li>
                                       <li>Send text messages or use social media to reach out to family and friends. Phone systems are often busy following a disaster. Make calls only in emergencies.</li>
                                       <li>Wear a NIOSH certified-respirator and wet debris down to minimize breathing dust particles.</li>  
                                       <li>Document property damage with photographs. Conduct an inventory and contact your insurance company for assistance.</li>
                                       <li>Wildfires dramatically change landscape and ground conditions, which can lead to increased risk of flooding due to heavy rains, flash flooding and mudflows. Flood risk remains significantly higher until vegetation is restored—up to 5 years after a wildfire. Consider purchasing flood insurance to protect the life you've built and to assure financial protection from future flooding.</li>
