                                       <li>Create an emergency communication plan with your family. Choose an out-of-town contact your family or household will call for refuge during the time of attack.</li>
                                       <li>Establish a meeting place. If you need to evacuate your home or are asked to "shelter in place," having some essential supplies on hand will make you and your family more comfortable. Prepare a disaster supplies kit in an easy-to-carry bag.</li>

A safe deposit box or the home of a friend or family member who lives out of town is a good choice.</li>
