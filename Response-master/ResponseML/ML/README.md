# This folder contains the notebook implementation and final pipeline for the machine learning algorithm

## Folder 1: ML1 algo
This folder deals with the first machine learning model which helps in classifying the news scraped as disaster relevant or irrelevant. The results obtained are:

### Logistic regression with the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of 0.89%

## Folder 2: ML2 algo
This folder has two models. The first one is the machine learning model which classifies the disaster according to its types. The classifications are:

1) Floods

2) Earthquakes

3) Wildfires

4) Pandemic

5) Violence

6) Storms

The results obtained are:

### Random forest with an accuracy, weighted average precision, weighted average recall, weighted average F1-score of 93%

The second model deals with extracting the location from the news. For this the spaCy libray is used.
